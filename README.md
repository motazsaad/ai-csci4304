# Artificial Intelligence Course Outline

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of AI. Students will gain a deep understanding of the current state of AI and its potential to transform various industries and aspects of life.

The course begins with an introduction to AI, exploring its definition, history, and significance. It then delves into the state of the art of AI, highlighting recent advancements and breakthroughs in the field.

The course then focuses on problem-solving and search algorithms, which are essential components of AI systems. Students will learn about various search algorithms, including breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, depth-first search, depth-limited search, iterative deepening search, best-first search, and A* search. The role of heuristics in search algorithms will also be discussed.

Next, the course explores intelligent agents, which are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve their goals. Students will learn about the design and implementation of intelligent agents and their applications in various domains.

Finally, the course introduces artificial neural networks, a key technology behind many AI applications. Students will learn about the basics of neural networks, including their architecture, training, and applications.
